What is Batch Processing?
Batch processing is a data processing method where large amounts of data are collected, stored, and processed at a scheduled time or in predefined batches. The processing is executed periodically rather than in real-time.

Key Characteristics of Batch Processing:
-->Processes large volumes of data at once
--> Executes jobs at scheduled intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)
--> Suitable for historical analysis and reporting
--> Requires significant compute power for processing large datasets
--> Typically higher latency compared to stream processing

How Batch Processing Works?

Data Collection: Raw data is collected from multiple sources (databases, logs, files, sensors).
Storage: The collected data is temporarily stored in data lakes, warehouses, or distributed storage (e.g., HDFS, Amazon S3).
Processing: Data is processed in bulk using frameworks like Apache Spark, Hadoop, or SQL-based tools.
Output: The processed data is loaded into BI tools, dashboards, or stored for further analysis.
Technologies Used in Batch Processing:
Apache Hadoop (MapReduce)
Apache Spark (Batch Mode)
AWS Glue
Google BigQuery
Microsoft Azure Data Factory

Real-Life Example of Batch Processing
Example: Monthly Salary Processing in a Payroll System

Scenario:
A company has 10,000 employees, and every month, their salaries are calculated based on various factors such as attendance, bonuses, tax deductions, and benefits.

How Batch Processing is Used?
Data Collection: Employee attendance logs, tax records, salary structures, and bank details are collected.
Storage: All the data is stored in a relational database or data warehouse.
Processing: At the end of the month, a batch job runs to process salaries for all employees.
Output: The system generates salary slips, deducts taxes, and sends payment instructions to the bank.
Why Use Batch Processing?
--> The system doesnâ€™t need to process salaries in real-time.
--> Large volumes of data are processed efficiently.
--> High computational power is allocated only during payroll processing.



What is Stream Processing?
Stream processing is a data processing method where data is processed in real-time as soon as it is generated. This allows businesses to take immediate actions based on incoming data.

Key Characteristics of Stream Processing:
--> Processes data continuously as it arrives
--> Low latency (near real-time or real-time)
--> Handles high-velocity data streams from sensors, logs, and social media
--> Requires distributed computing and fault tolerance
--> Used for real-time decision-making

How Stream Processing Works?

Data Ingestion: Real-time data is continuously generated from sources such as IoT sensors, social media, financial transactions, etc.
Processing: Data is processed instantly using frameworks like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or Apache Spark Streaming.
Real-Time Actions: The processed data triggers alerts, dashboards, or automated responses.
Technologies Used in Stream Processing:
Apache Kafka
Apache Flink
Apache Spark Streaming
AWS Kinesis
Google Cloud Dataflow

Real-Life Example of Stream Processing
Example: Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions

Scenario:
A bank processes millions of transactions daily. It needs to detect fraudulent activities such as unusual withdrawals or transactions in real-time to prevent fraud.

How Stream Processing is Used?
Data Ingestion: The bank continuously receives transaction data from ATMs, mobile banking apps, and credit cards.
Processing: A stream processing system (e.g., Kafka + Flink) analyzes each transaction in real-time.
Real-Time Actions: If an unusual transaction (e.g., a withdrawal from two different countries within minutes) is detected, the system immediately blocks the transaction and alerts the customer.

Why Use Stream Processing?
--> Immediate fraud detection reduces financial losses.
--> Customers receive instant notifications about suspicious activity.
--> Helps in regulatory compliance by monitoring transactions in real-time.
