Pivoting means rotating data from rows into columns so that it’s easier to compare and analyze.

Think of it like creating an Excel pivot table inside your database.

Converting unique values from single column into multiple columns

WITHOUT PIVOT--LONG TABLE(DEPTH)
WITH PIVOTING--WIDE TABLE(BREADTH)



Data Analysis & Reporting

Easier to read: Instead of scanning rows, you see comparisons side by side.

Quickly spot trends (e.g., which month had highest sales).

Comparisons Across Categories
Compare multiple dimensions (e.g., Laptop vs. Phone sales per month).

You don’t need to manually join or filter repeatedly.

Aggregations
You can pivot by sums, averages, counts, max/min, etc.

We have unpivoting too (reverse of this processs)

all/long format → Best for storage, queries, and machine processing.

Wide/pivoted format → Best for presentation, reporting, and human analysis.
