A DataFrame is a 2-d data structure that can store data of different types (including char, int, float point values, cat data and more) in columns. 
It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R.

When selecting a single column of a pandas DataFrame, the result is a pandas Series.
To select the column, use the column label in between square brackets [].
