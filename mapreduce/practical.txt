The provided codes demonstrate sequential execution of the MapReduce logic to make the concepts easier to understand

In real world scenarios:
The map step would run in parallel across multiple processors or machines, each handling a chunk of data..
Intermediate key-value pairs are grouped and distributed across multiple machines, where each machine processes a subset of keys..
